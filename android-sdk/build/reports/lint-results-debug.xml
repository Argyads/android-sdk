Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.&#xA;&#xA;For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. **NOTE**: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add **both** the older left/right attributes **as well as** the new start/end attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/end attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.&#xA;&#xA;(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"
